== PASIO ==

Pasio is a tool for denosing DNA coverage profiles coming from high-throughput sequencing data.
Example of experiments pasio works well on is ChIP-seq, DNAse-seq, ATAC-seq.

It takes a .bed file of counts (integer values, normalization is not supported). And produces
tsv file with genome splited into segments which coverage can be treated as equal.

Pasio runs on both python 2 and 3. The only dependencies are numpy and scipy.

Recommended commandline for most practical cases is:

`
python src/pasio.py
      --bedgraph ~/<PATH TO INPUT bed.Graph FILE> -o ~/<WAY TO OUTPUT bedGraph FILE>
      --alpha 5 --beta 1 --algorithm rounds
      --window_shift 1250 --window_size 2500
`
